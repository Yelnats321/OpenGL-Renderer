# OpenGL Renderer
This is a pet project of mine that explores various 3D rendering techniques and techonologies. Currently, the list of features are:
- Modern OpenGL, using various features from 3.1 - 4.3
- Multiple shaders and multipass rendering
- Post processing effects
- .obj/.mtl model loading and management
- Bump mapping
- Alpha to coverage
- Blinn-phong shading model
- Point lighting with 3D shadow maps
- GPU voxelization
- PhysX intergration

Features that I might be interested in implementing in the future:
- Volumetric smoke and various similair effects
- SSAO
- Deferred rendering
- Directional lights (very easy to implement, just haven't found a need for it yet)
- Multiple lights (probably with deferred rendering)
- Cone tracing and other physicality based rendering techniques
